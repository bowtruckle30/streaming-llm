The app is a chatbot that will remember the previous messages and respond to the user's input. The response from the chatbot will be streamed as it is being generated.

Usage

To run the app, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the app by running the following command in your terminal:

```
streamlit run src/app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit app, and you will be able to interact with the chatbot in your web browser.
